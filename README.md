# AngularTools

This is supposed to be a collection of tools for helping developing Angular projects.

And a collections always starts with a single tool and then it will grow as we find new handy tools.

* `ComponentHierarchy.py` is a tool that scans the Angular applications components and print out the hierarchy of the components. This is a quick way to get an overview of your project.
